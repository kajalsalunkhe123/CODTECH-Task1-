Overview of the Project

*Project Title:* Simulation of Blinking LED with Arduino using Proteus

*Objectives:*
1. To simulate basic embedded programming concepts using Proteus.
2. To understand how to interface software (Arduino code) with simulated hardware (Arduino board and LED) in Proteus.
3. To practice controlling simulated output devices (LED) using Arduino simulation tools.

*Key Activities:*
1. *Setting up Proteus Simulation Environment:* Install Proteus simulation software and set up the Arduino simulation component.
2. *Writing Arduino Code:* Develop Arduino code within Proteus to control the blinking of a simulated LED.
3. *Simulating Code Execution:* Run the simulation in Proteus to observe the LED blinking at the specified interval.
4. *Testing and Debugging:* Verify that the simulated LED behavior matches the programmed instructions in the Proteus environment.
5. *Documenting Results:* Record the simulated Arduino code and observations for future reference.

*Technologies Used:*
- *Proteus Simulation Software:* Used for simulating the Arduino board, uploading and running Arduino code, and simulating hardware interactions.
- *Arduino Board Component in Proteus:* Virtual representation of an Arduino microcontroller within the Proteus simulation environment.
- *Simulated LED:* Virtual LED component in Proteus that mimics the behavior of a physical LED, controlled by the simulated Arduino code.
